# cantina

Blenderexplorer blenderheads comming together for animation. Now for the 2nd time!

This time for a space cantina scene.

Our focus is team work experience and explorering supporting features.
The project is also a cummunity experiment. The team is very open for any level of blenderhead at any time. Any contribution is welcome. The only limitations are for memory and cpu conserns.

Any entertainment or story you may see in the finaly product is purely by dumb luck. 



/blend directory contains a 'main.blend' file. Other files are linked into this file. If you want to see the animation in blender, use this file.
It is how ever not setup for rendering atm. You'll need to ask for those files.

How to get started: Doing this requres a little knowledge of github. If you need help, feel free to contact me. But first watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E&feature=youtu.be And look over this page: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

In short, what you do: Branch the project, add your files. Request a pull to master. Be carefull when working on files that others are working on in their branches. This may result in conflicting files that cant be automatically merged. It is recommended to coordinate with the file owner. The work branch is open for commiting with out protection. If you use work branch coordinate in discord.

Security recommendation: In preferences under save and load set 'Auto run python scripts' to diabled, before opening downloaded blender files. Alternatively do this for the folder 'downloads'.
